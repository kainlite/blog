### **Introduction**
Github offers static web hosting for you and your apps, you can use markdown (jekyll or just plain html), for example for this blog I generate all the files with Hugo.io and that gets deployed to Github Pages, the configuration is fairly simple as we will see in the following example (this blog).

### **Pages**
