### Introduction
This article is about my current configuration, but I'm going to talk only about the terminal and my text editor because those will work in any linux distribution, I'm currently using **Arch Linux** and **AwesomeWM** (I used Gnome Shell previously, and Gnome 2 before that), you can find my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/kainlite/dotfiles) with all my configurations.

### Tmux
I also use tmux to maintan sessions, some of it's nice features are tiling, tabs. The configuration can be [found here](https://github.com/kainlite/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf). I move between tabs with control-h and control-l, and between panes with control-a [hjkl].
